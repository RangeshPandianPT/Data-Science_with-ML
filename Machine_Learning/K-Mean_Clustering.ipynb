    "**K-Means clustering is one of the most widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It groups data points into a predefined number of clusters based on similarity. Unlike hierarchical clustering, K-Means does not build a dendrogram. Instead, it uses an iterative optimization process to assign each data point to the nearest cluster center.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind K-Means is simple:\n",
    "Group data so that points within a cluster are as close as possible to each other and as far as possible from points in other clusters.\n",

    "K-Means is especially useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to discover natural patterns or groupings.\n",
    "\n",

    "It is widely used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image compression, document clustering, and market basket analysis.\n"
