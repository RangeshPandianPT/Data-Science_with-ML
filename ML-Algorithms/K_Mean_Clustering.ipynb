    "## What is Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering is the process of grouping objects based on the information present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects are grouped according to their similarity or relationship with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is an unsupervised learning technique, meaning no predefined labels are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Main Objective of Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects within the same group or cluster should be highly similar to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects belonging to different clusters should be significantly different from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aim is to maximize intra-cluster similarity and minimize inter-cluster similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Key Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Works on unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps in discovering hidden patterns or structures in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Groups data points based on distance, density, or connectivity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why Clustering is Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To understand the natural grouping in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To simplify large datasets by summarizing them into clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To identify patterns, trends, or relationships that are not immediately obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Examples of Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer segmentation in marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grouping similar documents or articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social network analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**4. Important Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering does not predict outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It focuses on data exploration and structure discovery rather than classification."
