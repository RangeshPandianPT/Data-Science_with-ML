    "# What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear regression is a supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. When this relationship is linear, the algorithm attempts to fit a straight line through the data points that best represents the pattern in the data.**"

    "\n",
    "The cost function helps determine the best values for the intercept b₀ and slope b₁ so that the fitted line represents the data accurately. It works by minimizing the error between the actual values and the predicted values. This minimization finds the optimal parameters for the linear regression model."

    "Gradient descent is an optimization method used to update the parameters b₀ and b₁ in order to minimize the mean squared error. The algorithm repeatedly adjusts these values until the error reaches the minimum. A small learning rate moves slowly toward the minimum, while a large learning rate moves faster but may overshoot the optimal point."
