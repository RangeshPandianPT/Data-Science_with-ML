    "## How Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model mainly used for image recognition and computer vision tasks such as handwritten digit recognition, object detection, and image classification.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNNs automatically learn spatial features from images using convolution operations instead of manual feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Workflow of a CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Image → Feature Extraction → Classification → Output Label**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image of X → CNN → Output = X\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image of O → CNN → Output = O\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Layers in a Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "1. Convolution Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applies filters (kernels) to the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts important features such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Corners\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Textures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each filter slides over the image and produces a feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preserves spatial relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces number of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns features automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ReLU Layer (Rectified Linear Unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activation function applied after convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduces non-linearity into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReLU(x) = max(0, x)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removes negative values\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speeds up training\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps CNN learn complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces the spatial size of feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Max Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces computation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Controls overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes the model invariant to small image shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2×2 Max Pooling selects the maximum value from each block\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flattened feature maps are fed into dense neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performs classification based on learned features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combines all extracted features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produces final output probabilities or class labels\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN Classification Example\n",
    "Input Image\tCNN Output\n",
    "Handwritten X\tX\n",
    "Handwritten O\tO\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CNN learns distinguishing features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sharp crossing lines → X\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closed circular shape → O\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why CNNs Are Powerful**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fewer parameters than traditional neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- High accuracy for image-based problems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Works well with large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Applications of CNN**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handwritten digit recognition (MNIST)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Face recognition\n",

    "- Autonomous vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNNs use convolution, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- They learn features directly from images\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideal for computer vision and image classification tasks"
